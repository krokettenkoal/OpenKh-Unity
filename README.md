# OpenKh for Unity
Unity integration of [OpenKh](https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh).

## Installation
To install the package, simply clone the repository into your Unity project's `Assets` folder and run `git submodule update --init --recursive --depth 1` to clone all included submodules. Additionally, Noesis needs to be installed, which makes this package work reasonably only on Windows. Check out the *Dependencies* section for further info.

The package is planned to be available in the Unity asset store at some point in the future.

## Dependencies
[Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91) needs to be installed with [revel8n's KH2 plugin](https://github.com/DickBlackshack/NoesisPlugins/tree/master/LegacyRepo/revelation) for the FBX conversion (Asset Importer) to work. If the licenses permit it, those files will be included in the package in the future. This is currently under investigation.

## Documentation
Check out [OpenKh on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh/#documentation) or [openkh.dev](https://openkh.dev) for the OpenKh documentation. Unity-specific documentation for this package is not available at the moment.
