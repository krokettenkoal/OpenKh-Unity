# [Kingdom Hearts II](../../index.md) - AI

The AI is always located into BAR archives (under the extension of MDLX, MAG, etc.). They are used as a scripting language, compiled into bytecode to comunicate with the game engine.

By courtesy of [GovanifY](https://code.govanify.com/govanify/ghidra-kh2ai), there is a fairly complete documentation of [KH2 AI ISA](kh2ai.md) available. This entire documentation is generated from his repository and it is considered the most up-to-date version.
