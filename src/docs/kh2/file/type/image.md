# [Kingdom Hearts II](../../index.md) - Image

The game engine uses a custom texture format for all the 2D images to render.

## IMGD

Contains a single image. The [file structure](#file-structure) is defined below. Files of this type have `.imd` as extension.

## FAC

Contains multiple [IMGDs](#imgd) aligned by `0x800` and appended one after another. Files of this type have `.fac` as extension.

The only known FAC files are used by Jiminy's journal menu.

## IMGZ

Contains multiple [IMGDs](#imgd) prepended by a [specific header](#imz-header). They are appended one after another without any padding. Files of this type have `.imz` as extension.

## File structure

### IMGD Header

| Offset | Type | Description | Comment |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| 00 | uint32_t | Magic code, always `0x44474D49`
| 04 | uint32_t | Always `256`
| 08 | uint32_t | Bitmap offset
| 0c | uint32_t | Bitmap size in bytes
| 10 | uint32_t | Palette offset
| 14 | uint32_t | Palette size in bytes
| 18 | uint32_t | Always `-1`
| 1c | uint16_t | Image width
| 1e | uint16_t | Image height
| 20 | uint16_t | 2 to the power of image width (2ⁿ) | 2⁷ = 128, for example.
| 22 | uint16_t | 2 to the power of image height (2ⁿ) | Inversely, to calculate the desired value, run the following calculation (where X is the desired image width/height and n = value): log(X) / log(2) = n
| 24 | uint16_t | Image width divided by `64`
| 26 | uint16_t | [Image format](#image-formats)
| 28 | uint32_t | Always `-1`
| 2c | uint16_t | `8` when format is 4bpp, else `16`
| 2e | uint16_t | `2` when format is 4bpp, else `16`
| 30 | uint32_t | Always `1`
| 32 | uint16_t | `19` when format is 32bpp, else `0`
| 34 | uint16_t | `3` if 32bpp, `5` if 8bpp or `4` if 4bpp
| 36 | uint16_t | `0` when format is 32bpp, else `3`
| 38 | uint32_t | Always `0`
| 3c | uint32_t | `7` if the image is swizzled, else `3`

### IMZ header

| Offset | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 00 | uint32_t | Magic code, always `0x5A474D49`
| 04 | uint32_t | Always `256`
| 08 | uint32_t | Header length. Always `16`
| 0c | uint32_t | [IMGD](#imgd) count

### Image formats

| ID   | Format
|------|--------
| 0x00 | 32 bits per pixel
| 0x13 | 8 bits per pixel
| 0x14 | 4 bits per pixel
